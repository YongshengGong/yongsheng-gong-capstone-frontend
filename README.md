### Auth

- JWT Authentication:
    This is the process of verifying the identity of a user. When a user logs in with their credentials (like a username and password), the server authenticates the user's identity and issues a JWT token.
- JWT Authorization:
    After a user is authenticated, JWTs are used to control access to resources. The server checks the JWT to determine what resources the user is allowed to access.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system:
    RBAC assigns permissions to users based on their roles within an organization.
